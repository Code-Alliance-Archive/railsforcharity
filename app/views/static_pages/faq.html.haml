            %p

              which help the society in a big way. We think that with the availability of all the awesome open source software today, the stars have aligned

            %h4 What are the different kinds of open source project licences?
            %p
              There are many different kinds of open source licences. But all of them fall into 3 main categories.
              Largely Restrictive - example, GNU Public Licence. GPL entails that people should not make any profits from the open source software at all.
              Less Restrictive - example, Apache Licence. People can make profits out of using AL kind of licences, just that they have to give credits to
              people who made the softwares.
              Non-Restrictive - example, MIT Licence.

            %h4 How will we manage money issues?
            %p
              RFC is a not-for-profit social group. We do not and will not intend to create web applications from the motive of making money.
              There are a lot of social problems to solve which may not earn money but it will earn us a better world to live in. We will be able to
              make a better world for our children and their children to live in. We will run RFC using contributions made by RFC volunteers and
              various sponsorships and donations from companies and governments.
